# RealEstateNFT

This is a proof of concept model for Real Estate Ownership integration with the blockchain. 

The contract itself features a common syntax for all tokens, making it easy to identify and differentiate properties. Each token ID contains the year built, zip code, area in square feet, bathroom and bedroom count along with a "padding" system to account for exactly identical houses. 

The front end interface is still a work in progress, and while this proof of concept model works it is unlikely to see this or something similar in the near future. Buying a home and transfering ownership in a few moments replacing the arduous process that exists currently will be a difficult process, but possible.
